  description: |
    With the MyScience App, you can choose to provide your health data for <popup data-id="research">health research</popup>.
    <br><br>
    Research insights that are gained from using your <popup data-id="data">health data</popup> may substantially
    contribute to the goals of health research.
    <br><br>
    Providing health data for research is voluntary. If you do not wish to provide data for research, or wish to withdraw
    your consent later, it will not affect the medical care you receive or your ability to use your Smart4Health account.
    <br><br>
    In the following, <popup data-id="we">we</popup> describe the process and considerations related to providing your data to research.
    Please read the information provided, the <a target="blank" href="https://myscience-app.smart4health.eu/privacy-statement-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
    and the <a target="blank" href="https://myscience-app.smart4health.eu/terms-of-use-en.html">Terms of Use</a> carefully and take the time you need to
    make an informed decision. If you do not fully agree with the nature of data use, or if we have not fully answered your questions,
    you should not give your consent.

  - title: What kind of data do we ask you to provide?
    image: /svgs/data-storage.svg
    summary: |
      When you provide your health data, we ask you for the <popup data-id="core">core set of data</popup> as far as
      available in your Smart4Health account. You can also provide additional
      <popup data-id="optional">optional health data</popup>, depending on your personal preferences, which you can
      define in the MyScience App.
    description: ""

  - title: What happens when you provide your health data?
    image: /svgs/process.svg
    summary: |
      After confirming the provision of the core set of data and potentially selecting optional health data,
      we <popup data-id="personal">remove or generalize personal information</popup> in your data.
      We add a <popup data-id="code">code</popup> to your data. The data is now <popup data-id="pseudonym">“pseudonymised data”</popup>.
      This code is stored only in your MyScience App.
      We store the pseudonymised data in the research platform.
      <br><br>
      At the end of this process, you will receive a notification of the successful data provision.
      <br><br>
      Please be aware that in order for researchers to be able to use your health data for research, the <b>provision
      of a</b> <popup data-id="core">core set of data</popup> <b>is required</b>.
    description: ""

  - title: Who can access your data for health research?
    image: /svgs/research.svg
    summary: |
      Access to the data is controlled and researchers can work with the data only on the research platform (no download of data is allowed).
      <br><br>
      Researchers from universities, research institutions and <popup data-id="companies">commercial companies</popup>
      can apply for data access with their health research project. The <popup data-id="DAC">Smart4Health Data Access
      Committee</popup> reviews each research project. If it does not meet all criteria for data access, access is not granted. The
      data must not be used by other researchers or for other purposes than defined in the research project. Your health
      data will be used exclusively for scientific purposes and will not be sold.
      <br><br>
      Data access is restricted to researchers from EU countries or from countries where the EU has determined that
      adequate data protection measures are in place.
      Though your data will not be sold, the provider of the Smart4Health research platform may collect a handling fee
      from the respective researchers, in the future.
      <br><br>
      Using data for scientific purpose includes publishing results in a form that <b>does not
      allow any conclusions about or links to your identity</b>.
    description: ""

  - title: How is your data used?
    image: /svgs/how-is-used.svg
    summary: |
      Your health data will only be used for health research. Using your data for health research means that
      <b>researchers will access your data within the Smart4Health research platform</b>, combine it with data provided
      by other users, and analyse them with tools running on the research platform to find answers to various
      health research questions.
      <br><br>
      The results of these analyses are exported from the research platform to be shared and discussed with others.
      Your health data does not leave the Smart4Health research platform without your explicit consent.
    description: ""

  - title: Who decides which research uses your data?
    image: /svgs/scientific-databases.svg
    summary: |
      We do not offer the possibility to select the kind of research or the research fields. Research may refer to
      whole areas of disease (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular diseases, brain diseases) as well as to specific diseases
      and to changes in the genetic substance that are still partly unknown today. This means that your health data
      may be used for research questions that we cannot foresee today.
    description: ""

  - title: How can you provide additional data for research?
    image: /svgs/search.svg
    summary: |
      Whenever you have new personal health data stored in your <i>Smart4Health account</i> you can also provide this
      data for research using the <i>MyScience App</i>.
      <br><br>
      Alternatively, you can decide to allow the <b>automatic provision of future data</b> using the <i>MyScience App</i>.
      This means that data you have newly collected will be automatically provided.
      <br><br>
      This applies to all new data matching your selection.
      <br><br>
      You will receive a notification of the successful provision as a push-message or as an email according to your preferences
    description: ""

  - title: Does your health data leave the Smart4Health research platform?
    image: /svgs/exit.svg
    summary: |
      If you have consented to this, a copy of your data is transferred from the Smart4Health research platform to
      <popup data-id="ELIXIR">ELIXIR-LU</popup>. For this purpose, we <popup data-id="anonym">anonymize</popup> the
      data by removing your code. ELIXIR-LU has access criteria comparable to our access criteria.
      <br><br>
      At acceptance, the data can be downloaded by the researcher. The researcher’s institution is responsible for and supervises the data processing.
    description:
      You can choose whether or not a copy of the data you provided to the Smart4Health research platform may also be
      transferred to ELIXIR-LU, the publicly funded Luxembourgish national node of ELIXIR, the European infrastructure
      for life science information. In this case, the pseudonymized data is anonymized and copied from the Smart4Health research platform to ELIXIR-LU.
      <br><br>
      The data access request must be approved by the ELIXIR-LU Data Access Committee following the data access
      criteria comparable to the ones outlined in <a target="blank" href="https://smart4health.eu/dac">https://smart4health.eu/dac</a>. The process and
      criteria correspond to those described before.
      However, in case of approval, researchers will download the data. The responsibility and supervision of
      the data lies with the receiving institution, which ensures a level of data security and compliance measures
      comparable to those established in Smart4Health.

  - title: What are the risks associated with providing your health data?
    image: /svgs/warning.svg
    summary: |
      Whenever you provide data, there is a risk that private information is disclosed. Data stored in the Smart4Health
      research platform is separated from your name and other personal identifiers. We have implemented further
      adequate procedures to minimize this risk.
      <br><br>
      If your private information has been misused, you could experience harms, such as stress, anxiety, stigmatization,
      or embarrassment from revealing information about your family relations or health condition.
      <br><br>
      In the case of a data breach, we will contact you within 72 hours.
    description: |
      The code linking your data to your identity is stored separately and securely within your
      MyScience App on your smartphone and therefore remains with you. Any attempt to identify you from
      the provided health data is prohibited by law and impracticable in practice as it would require a disproportionate
      amount of time, expense, and labor.
      <br><br>
      If you agree to provide pseudonymized data to the Smart4Health research platform or anonymized data to ELIXIR-LU,
      it is important to remember that pseudonymization and anonymization of your health data can never completely rule
      out the possibility of re-identification by drawing on other data sources.
      <br><br>
      Examples for misuse of private information are, e.g., taking actions on your behalf or blackmailing you with the
      threat to disclose health information.
      <br><br>
      In the case of a data breach, we will contact you via the MyScience app within 72 hours after we have become aware
      of the breach according to Article 33 and 34 of the EU GDPR.

  - title: What are the benefits for society?
    image: /svgs/charity-help.svg
    summary: |
      Health research carried out with your data aims to understand how
      <ul>
      <li>diseases develop over time, </li>
      <li> prevention and detection of diseases and conditions can be improved, and </li>
      <li>treatment and care can be improved. </li>
      </ul>
      This has the potential to
      <ul>
      <li>reduce severity and costs of illness,</li>
      <li>prevent illness and improve health, and therefore</li>
      <li>increase the quality of life.</li>
      </ul>
      You can learn about research activities based on the data in the Smart4Health research platform
      at <a target="blank" href="https://smart4health.eu/research">https://smart4health.eu/research</a>.
    description: ""

  - title: What are the benefits for you personally?
    image: /svgs/charity-tree.svg
    summary: |
      No direct benefit to your health can be expected from providing your data for health research.
      However, you can also enjoy the benefits for society.
      Neither provision nor non-provision of data for research will impact the concrete medical treatment you may receive.
      <br><br>
      If the research leads to commercial benefits, e.g., through the development of new drugs or diagnostic procedures,
      you will neither have rights in the results nor receive a share in the profits.
    description: ""

  - title: How can you withdraw your consent?
    image: /svgs/exit.svg
    summary: |
      Providing data for research is voluntary. You can withdraw your consent to provide health data for research with
      effect for the future at any time, without consequences for you. You can do this in whole, or in parts by
      changing individual statements.
      <br><br>
      Use the withdraw function in the MyScience App or <popup data-id="contact">contact</popup> us
      directly (e.g., <a href="mailto:helpdesk@smart4health.eu">helpdesk@smart4health.eu</a>).
      <br><br>
      If you withdraw, your health data will be <popup data-id="anonym">anonymized</popup>. This anonymized data
      will not be used for any future research within the Smart4Health research platform. However, it has to remain accessible for a
      duration of 10 years to ensure that research results of completed and ongoing research projects can be reproduced.
    description: |
      Note that data cannot be removed from completed and ongoing projects or if anonymized data has been transmitted
      to ELIXIR-LU as we cannot trace it back to you.
      <br><br>
      You may also change individual parts of the declaration of consent without withdrawing it in whole.
      For example, you may change your consent preferences if you wish to continue to make the health data
      available to research but no longer have interest in being contacted for study participation.
      <br><br>
      As we explained in the section on risks, anonymization of your health data can never completely rule
      out the possibility of re-identification by drawing on other data sources.

  - title: How long is your consent valid?
    image: /svgs/circular-clock-time.svg
    summary: |
      Your consent to the provision of health data for research within the Smart4Health research platform is
      valid for the duration of the Smart4Health project, which will presumably end on February 28, 2023, unless
      you have withdrawn your consent before its end.
      <br><br>
      You can continue to provide your health data after the end of the project by signing a re-consent form. If
      you do not re-consent, your health data that has been stored based on this consent will be anonymized, by
      erasing the code that has been assigned to you.
      As in the case of withdrawing your consent, this anonymized data will not be used for any future research.
      It will remain accessible for a duration of 10 years for completed and ongoing research projects to ensure
      that research results can be reproduced.
      <br><br>
      The optional provision of health data to ELIXIR-LU is unaffected by the project end. Anonymized health
      data that was already provided to ELIXIR-LU remains on their premises. This anonymized data cannot be traced back
      to you and therefore cannot be deleted upon your request.
      It remains available to be used for research.
    description: ""

  - title: Right of withdrawal
    image: /svgs/stop-violence.svg
    summary: |
      <i><b>I voluntarily consent to provide my data for research.</b></i> I may withdraw my consent in whole or in part in the
      <i>MyScience App</i> or by contacting HPI at any time, without giving reasons and without any consequences for me.
      <br><br>
      Upon withdrawal, the data stored on the basis of this consent will not be used for future research.
      It will be deleted (anonymized). Data from already performed analyses cannot be removed.
